# Set
    Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

# Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data,
 the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.


 * Note: Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.

# Set Items
    Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.

# Unordered
    Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.

    Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.

# Unchangeable

    Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can remove items and add new items.

Set items can be of any data type:
A set can contain different data types:


# The set() Constructor
It is also possible to use the set() constructor to make a set.
thisset = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
